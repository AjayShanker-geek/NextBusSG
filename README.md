## Built setup
Your system requires the Flutter SDK. Follow the steps here to [install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) it on your system.

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. In the `lib` folder, create `keys.dart`.

In `keys.dart`, paste the following:

```
final String apiKey = '<LTA API KEY>';
```

To get an API key, go to [LTA's Request For API Access web page](https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall/request-for-api.html) and fill out the form. The key is **required** for the app to work properly.

Once the key as been set up, the app can be tested with the following commands:
```
flutter run
```

### Generating icons and splash screens
After updating `pubspec.yaml`, run these commands:
```
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
flutter pub pub run flutter_native_splash:create

```

### Stuck at installing debug Android app?
Go to app settings and uninstall your app. The app may not appear in your launcher, but it could still be installed. Go to your settings, find it, and completely uninstall it.

This can also be done using ADB:

```
adb uninstall com.themindstorm.nextbussg
```

If this does not work, check out this [answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53394504/flutter-stuck-at-installing-build-app-outputs-apk-app-apk).

### Build Android APK and appbundle
```
flutter build appbundle
flutter build apk
```

Once the APK has been built, install it on a physcally connected Android device:
```
flutter install
```

If you have multiple devices, you can view a list of Android devices connected using this command:

```
adb devices
```

And to install the app on an Android device, copy the device ID and install the app using

```
flutter install <devce ID>
```
