## FAQs
### 1. How do I add or remove favorites?
- **Double tap** or **Long press** on any bus service tile, 
- The prompt to add/remove should appear
### 2. Why aren't all my favorites showing?
on the home page, only favorites that are **near** will be shown. To see all your favorites, click on the **"See all"** button.
### 3. How do I rename a bus stop?
There are two ways:
1. Either add the stop to your favorites, then go the "More" page (the third tab on the bottom bar), then tap **"Rename favorites"**, or
2. Search for the bus stop in the search page (second tab), and press the **"Rename"** button.
### 4. How do I see more information on a particular bus stop?
There are two ways:
1. Either tap the bus service tile's 5-digit code (ex: 84009), or
2. Search for the bus stop in the search page, tap on the results to see more information
