**Double tap** or **Long press** on any bus service tile, and a prompt should appear asking if you want to add or remove that bus service from your favorites list.

# Why aren't all my favorites showing?
on the home page, only favorites that are **near** will be shown. To see all your favorites, click on the **"See all"** button.

# How do I rename a bus stop?
There are two ways:
  1. Add the stop to your favorites, then go the "More" page (the third tab on the bottom bar), then tap **"Rename favorites"**
  2. Search for the bus stop in the search page (second tab), and press the **"Rename"** button.
